You can write regular [markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) here and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:
 
| NOMBRES | APELLIDOS| Previous number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |:--- |
| JUAN CARLOS | GUZMAN TORREZ | TRES |TRES |
| ANA MARIA | LIMA LOPEZ | Nine |TRES |
| JOSE LUIS | Eight | Six |TRES |
| MARIA DEL CARMEN | Three | One |TRES |
 | JOSE LUIS | Eight | Six |TRES |
| MARIA DEL CARMEN | Three | One |TRES |
